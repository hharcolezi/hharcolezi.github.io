Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. student at University Bourgogne Franche-Comté (UBFC), working with Prof. Jean-François Couchot. I received my M.Eng. in Electrical engineering from São Paulo State University (UNESP) in 2017, under the supervision of Prof. Aparecido Augusto de Carvalho.

Currently, I focus on optimizing locally differentially private (LDP) protocols for longitudinal and multidimensional studies to ensure that the estimated frequencies are close to the original ones in statistical properties. Besides, I am also enthusiastic about applying machine learning algorithms over (locally) differentially private data.

## News

* Our paper "Random Sampling Plus Fake Data: Multidimensional Frequency Estimates With Local Differential Privacy" has been accepted to [CIKM 2021](https://www.cikm2021.org/).
