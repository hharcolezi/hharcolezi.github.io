Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. student at University Bourgogne Franche-Comté (UBFC), working with prof. Jean-François Couchot. I received my M.Eng. in Electrical engineering from São Paulo State University (UNESP) in 2017, under the supervision of prof. Aparecido Augusto de Carvalho.

Currently, I focus on optimizing locally differentially private (LDP) protocols for longitudinal and multidimensional studies to ensure that the estimated frequencies are close to the original ones in statistical properties. This is because I am also enthusiastic about applying machine learning algorithms over (locally) differentially private data.
