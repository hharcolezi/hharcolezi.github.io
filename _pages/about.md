Welcome! I'm a Posdoctoral Researcher on the [Comète research team](https://team.inria.fr/Comete/) led by [Catuscia Palamidessi](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Catuscia.Palamidessi/) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) -- [LIX](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/), [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en). 

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University Bourgogne Franche-Comté ([UBFC](https://spim.ubfc.fr/en/)) in 2022, working with Profs. [Jean-François Couchot](https://members.femto-st.fr/jf-couchot/en), [Bechara Al Bouna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bechara-al-bouna-aa94927/?originalSubdomain=lb), and [Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/).\
Before that, I received my M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering from São Paulo State University ([UNESP](https://www.feis.unesp.br/#!/ppgee)) in 2019, under the supervision of Prof. [Aparecido Augusto de Carvalho](http://lattes.cnpq.br/0250066159980825). 

Currently, my research interests are differential privacy and machine learning privacy/fairness. 

## News
