Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. student at University Bourgogne Franche-Comté (UBFC), working with Profs. [Jean-François Couchot](https://members.femto-st.fr/jf-couchot/en), [Bechara Al Bouna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bechara-al-bouna-aa94927/?originalSubdomain=lb), and [Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/). I received my M.Eng. in Electrical engineering from São Paulo State University (UNESP) in 2017, under the supervision of Prof. Aparecido Augusto de Carvalho.

Currently, I research Differential Privacy (DP) with a focus on optimizing locally differentially private (LDP) protocols for longitudinal and multidimensional studies to ensure that the estimated frequencies are close to the original ones in statistical properties. Besides, I am also enthusiastic about applying machine learning algorithms over (locally) differentially private data.

## News

* I’m joining the [Comète research team](https://team.inria.fr/Comete/) in February 2022 as a Post-Doc fellow to work with Prof. [Catuscia Palamidessi](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Catuscia.Palamidessi/).
* Our new preprint "Improving the Utility of Locally Differentially Private Protocols for Longitudinal and Multidimensional Frequency Estimates" can be acessed on <https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04636>. 
* I received a Ph.D. mobility grant to visit the [Université du Québec à Montréal](https://uqam.ca/) and work with Prof. [Sébastien Gambs](https://sebastiengambs.openum.ca/) in November 2021.
* Our paper "Privacy-Preserving Prediction of Victim's Mortality and Their Need for Transportation to Health Facilities" has been accepted to [IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics](http://www.ieee-ies.org/pubs/transactions-on-industrial-informatics).
* Our paper "Random Sampling Plus Fake Data: Multidimensional Frequency Estimates With Local Differential Privacy" has been accepted to [CIKM 2021](https://www.cikm2021.org/) with a SIGIR Grant for Student Authors.
* I have been selected to attend the [6th Rencontre Entreprises DOCtorants en Sécurité (REDOCS'21)](https://gdr-securite.irisa.fr/redocs/redocs21/).
