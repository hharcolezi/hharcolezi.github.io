Welcome! I'm a tenured research scientist at [Inria Grenoble](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-grenoble-alpes) working with the [Privatics](https://team.inria.fr/privatics/) team. 
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Comète](https://team.inria.fr/Comete/) team at [Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-saclay-centre). 
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University Bourgogne Franche-Comté ([UBFC](https://spim.ubfc.fr/en/)) and my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the São Paulo State University ([UNESP](https://www.feis.unesp.br/#!/ppgee)). 

Currently, my research interests are differential privacy and responsible AI (e.g., privacy, fairness, and explainability).
