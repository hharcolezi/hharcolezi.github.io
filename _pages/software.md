### Open-Source Libraries

- multi-freq-ldpy [[GitHub]](https://github.com/hharcolezi/multi-freq-ldpy) [[PyPI]](https://pypi.org/project/multi-freq-ldpy/) [[ESORICS Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02648)\
Multi-Freq-LDPy is a Python library for performing multiple frequency estimation tasks (multidimensional, longitudinal, and both) under local differential privacy (LDP) guarantees. Multi-Freq-LDPy features various state-of-the-art LDP algorithms such as k-RR, OUE, Google's RAPPOR, OLH, RS+FD, and Microsoft's dBitFlipPM. The package is distributed under MIT license.

### Open-Source Code from Papers
- I maintain a list of DP and LDP experiments at [ldp-protocols-mobility-cdrs](https://github.com/hharcolezi/ldp-protocols-mobility-cdrs).
