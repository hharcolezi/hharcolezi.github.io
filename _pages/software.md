I maintain a list of DP and LDP experiments at [ldp-protocols-mobility-cdrs](https://github.com/hharcolezi/ldp-protocols-mobility-cdrs) for some of the works I carried out during my Ph.D. thesis.

### Open-Source Libraries

- multi-freq-ldpy [[GitHub]](https://github.com/hharcolezi/multi-freq-ldpy) [[PyPI]](https://pypi.org/project/multi-freq-ldpy/) [[ESORICS Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02648)\
Multi-Freq-LDPy is a Python library for performing multiple frequency estimation tasks (multidimensional, longitudinal, and both) under local differential privacy (LDP) guarantees. Multi-Freq-LDPy features various state-of-the-art LDP algorithms such as k-RR, SS, OUE, OLH, RS+FD, Google's RAPPOR, and Microsoft's dBitFlipPM. The package is distributed under MIT license.

### Datasets

- MS-FIMU (Mobility Scenario FIMU) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/hharcolezi/OpenMSFIMU) [[IWCMC Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1109/iwcmc48107.2020.9148138)\
An open, longitudinal (7 days), multidimensional (7 attributes), and synthetic dataset of faked virtual humans generated by an optimization approach applied to a real-life call-detail-records-based anonymized database.\
This dataset can be used for ML classification tasks and for evaluating (locally) differentially private mechanisms on multidimensional and/or longitudinal data.

- Multivariate-Mobility-Paris [[NCAA GitHub]](https://github.com/hharcolezi/ldp-protocols-mobility-cdrs/blob/main/papers/%5B3%5D/ML_final_df_real.csv) [[Paper]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-022-07393-0)\
The original dataset was provided by Orange telecom in France, which contains anonymized and aggregated human mobility data. The Multivariate-Mobility-Paris dataset comprises information from 2020-08-24 to 2020-11-04 (72 days during the COVID-19 pandemic), with time granularity of 30 minutes and spatial granularity of 6 coarse regions in Paris, France. In other words, it represents a multivariate time series dataset. This dataset can be used for several time-series tasks such as univariate/multivariate forecasting/classification with classic, machine learning, and privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.
