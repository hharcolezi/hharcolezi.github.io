Abstract: Modeling and understanding people's mobility at a temporal and geographical space are very strict requirements for developing better strategies of urban public and private transportation systems as well as establishing improved business techniques. This work proposes a random-search based approach to instantiate statistical indicators through an improved mobility scenario which provides specific information about people attending one or several days for some events. Then, we recreate that scenario with virtual humans, proposing a synthetic and open dataset that matches the original statistical data. The results show the proposed approach is very efficient to model people's mobility, and the generated data has a low error rate compared to the original one.
